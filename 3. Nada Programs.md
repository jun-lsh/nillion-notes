# Nada Language

As previously stated, programs using Nillion's MPC Protocol are written in their own language called _Nada_, which is a strongly typed compiled language built on top of Python (for the timebeing)

With Nada, you can store (for now, exclusively) Integers as Secrets on the network, upon which you can apply [a limited set of operations](https://docs.nillion.com/nada-lang-operators) to them.

# Party IDs

Given that the core concept behind Nillion is enabling MPC, due to the network not currently being live, it is fairly hard to tell how _exactly_ you, as a party, may be represented in the network.
