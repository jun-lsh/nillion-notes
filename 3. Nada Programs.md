# Nada Language

As previously stated, programs using Nillion's MPC Protocol are written in their own language called _Nada_, which is a strongly typed compiled language built on top of Python (for the timebeing)

With Nada, you can store (for now, exclusively) Integers as Secrets on the network, upon which you can apply [a limited set of operations](https://docs.nillion.com/nada-lang-operators) to them.

# Party IDs

Given that the core concept behind Nillion is enabling MPC, due to the network not currently being live, it is fairly hard to tell how other users can interact with a shared program to supply their secrets.

In previous discussion of secret sharing schemes, each participanting party is both a provider of secret data and a holder of other's secret shares. 

Presumably, when one deploys a program on the network, it is shared within a cluster of nodes (implied in [the docs](https://docs.nillion.com/nada-lang-programs)), so then any secrets supplied to the program should be secret shared within this cluster as well?
