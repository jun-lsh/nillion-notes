# Nada Language

As previously stated, programs using Nillion's MPC Protocol are written in their own language called _Nada_, which is a strongly typed compiled language built on top of Python (for the timebeing)

With Nada, you can store (for now, exclusively) Integers as Secrets on the network, upon which you can apply [a limited set of operations](https://docs.nillion.com/nada-lang-operators) to them.

# Parties and Confusion

Given that the core concept behind Nillion is enabling MPC, due to the network not currently being live, it is fairly hard to tell how other users can interact with a shared program to supply their secrets. Right now, it seems like the parties are defined in a program with a unique party ID, but your secrets are still loaded from just one secrets file when [demoing on a local testnet](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-python-starter/blob/main/examples_and_tutorials/core_concept_multi_party_compute/config.py)

Looking at the config file for MPC, we see that each party has a _User key_, which is the private key of a user, and a _Node key_, which is the private key for a node. What is unclear now is the relationship â€” is the node owned by the user? Is this a bootnode? 

In previous discussion of secret sharing schemes, each participating party is both a provider of secret data and a holder of other's secret shares, in which case we would fall under the assumption that every user has their own node that is a representation of them. But this assumption shouldn't hold in the live network, with this one node per client issue being deemed simply a [limitation](https://docs.nillion.com/limitations) of the testnet.  Presumably, when one deploys a program on the network, it is shared within a cluster of nodes (implied in [the docs](https://docs.nillion.com/nada-lang-programs)), so then any secrets supplied to the program should be secret shared within this cluster as well... right?

The answer is: I'm not sure either.

# Single Party Computation

This, perhaps, is one of the more confusing demoes for Nillion.

Nillion supports $(1,1)$ secret sharing. Sort of.

Their [GitHub](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/nillion-python-starter/tree/main/examples_and_tutorials/core_concept_single_party_compute) contains a lot of examples for Single Party Computation, where a user shares secrets with the network, then requests the network to perform the computation for them and reveal the resultant output. What is confusing is _why_ you would require this beyond a nifty technical demo. The computational cost to secret share private data with a whole network, then request the network to perform computations on those shares far, far outweighs _simply running the calculations locally, privately_. 

Let's continue the discussion in the next section...
