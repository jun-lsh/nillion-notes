# Nillion's Novel MPC Protocol

It's time for some literature review. [This](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1740) is the paper that Nillion's MPC Protocol is based off, so let's dig into what's all the hooha about.

# What is Secret Sharing?

Linear Secret Sharing Schemes (LSSS) are built upon the concept of... well, _secret sharing_.

Secret sharing is the concept in which a secret is broken up into shares which can be distributed. Each share does not reveal any information about the original secret, but the combination of certain shares among participants can reveal the original information.

Basically, from a set of participants, with a secret sharing scheme, only authorized subsets can reconstruct a secret. 

However, why would you want a secret to be distributed? In theory, let's say you have a piece of highly confidential information that's really important. So important, in fact, that you want to avoid it going _missing_. Let's say you encrypt the secret and share it with a group — you can boost the reliability of its retrieval by sharing the decryption key with them, but then confidentiality is lowered since multiple copies of the singular key exists.

This is where secret sharing can come in: you'd be sharing fragments of a key with a group of people, where as long as the number of traitors is sufficiently low, you can presume the secret is safe as it requires _group participation_ to be reconstructed. 

As a more formal definition [(ref)](https://65610.csail.mit.edu/2024/lec/l15-ss.pdf):

A $(t, n)$ secret sharing scheme over message space $M$ is a pair of algorithms where:
- $Share$ is a randomized algorithm that takes an input message $m$ from $M$ and outputs a n-tuple of _shares_ $(s_1, s_2... s_n)$
- $Reconstruct$ is a deterministic algorithm that, given a t-tuple of shares, outputs the original message $m$
## Practical Applications of Secret Sharing

This is where a toughie comes in. What is a practical application of this? Is this even applied in the real world?

Well, you can use something like Shamir's Secret-Sharing Scheme to share [mnemonic codes](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md) so that you can split, say, a Bitcoin wallet's secret key — this is sort of like multisig, but it's... not exactly multisig.

Bar this, I can't for the life of me find any direct applications of secret sharing that have been applied in a real world, practical context. 

Using secret sharing, however, we can construct a Secure Multiparty Computation scheme...

# Homomorphisms and Linear Combinations

Note that we've described secret sharing above, but not _linear_ secret sharing. The "linear" arises if the reconstruction of the secret from the shares is a linear mapping. This means if we apply linear operations to the shares, this translates to operations being performed on the secret upon reconstruction. In other words, a _linearly homomorphic_ secret sharing scheme.

As a practical example, let's say we have two secrets $X$ and $Y$, where $Share(X) = (x_1, ... x_n)$ and $Share(Y) = (y_1, ... y_n)$, where each of the $n$ players receives the shares $x_i$ and $y_i$. Then, if we have a $(t, n)$ linear secret sharing scheme, if every player were to sum their secrets to form $z_i = x_i + y_i$, then a t-tuple of secrets $z_i$ passed into $Reconstruct$ will output the sum of the original secrets, $X+Y$.

This sounds a lot like multiparty computation to me!

Generalizing our idea, we have instead that participants $i$ holds a secret $s_i$ rather than a share of a common secret. Then, instead of having a $(t, n)$ secret sharing scheme on some message $m$, we instead had a $(t, n)$ secret sharing scheme that would output $f(s_1, s_2 ..., s_n)$, where $f$  is a publicly known function. And in this situation, even with $t$ participants, they would not be able to reveal information about the other inputs $s_i$ that is not implied by the output of the function. 

# The Math

So this is the part where it gets... technical.

I'll be covering the math to get a better understanding of what exactly Nillion is bringing to the table that's _new_ and a non-technical section will be written up to describe it. 

## Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme

We seek to construct a $(t, n)$ secret sharing scheme. 

Let's start by first exploring a seemingly unrelated concept: polynomials.

How many points do you need to define a polynomial? 

Well, you need 2 points to define a line (degree 1), 3 points to define a quadratic (degree 2), 4 points to define a cubic equation (degree 3)... So you need $d$ points to define a polynomial of degree $d+1$.  This polynomial is also uniquely defined (this is a trivial proof via contradiction).

What's more fascinating is that this holds even in Finite Fields, where the field that we're usually interested with in cryptography being a prime Galois Field — a field with the elements $\\\{0, 1 ... p-1\\\}$ where your addition and multiplication are done modulo $p$. 

So how is this useful? Recall that in a $(t, n)$ sharing scheme, what we want is for subset of participants with count $k \geq t$ to be able to reconstruct a secret message $m$, and any less than $t$ will not work out. 

With this polynomial idea, we know that $t$ points would be the minimum required to construct a polynomial of degree $t-1$, so how about we build our system around polynomials of degree $t-1$!

### Setup

We want to share a message $m$ of length $\ell$ bits, so we will apply a single-bit secret sharing scheme $\ell$ times. As for the Galois Field, we choose a prime $p \gt n$. 

With $n$ participants, we assign a unique number to each participant $\alpha_i$, where the set $\\\{\alpha_1..., \alpha_n\\\}$ is known to all participants. A simple construction for this would be to set $\alpha_i = i$.
### $Share$ Function

We generate $t-1$ random numbers in $GF[p]$ $\\\{a_1, ... a_{t-1}\\\}$ and use these as coefficients for a polynomial of degree $t-1$, where the constant term $a_0 = m$. 

Our constructed function is then $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 ... a_{t-1} x^{t-1}$.

Then, every participant is given their own secret share $s_i = f(\alpha_i)$ in some confidential manner. Obviously, this $f(x)$ cannot be known by the participants, if not it is a trivial affair to retrieve the secret $m$.
### $Reconstruct$ Function

Solve $t$ linear equations in $t$ variables. Each player possesses a point $(\alpha_i, f(\alpha_i))$, so if you get $t$ players together, the can reconstruct $f(x)$ and subsequently $f(0) = a_0 = m$ via polynomial interpolation. 

## Linear Secret Sharing

Now that we've established how Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme functions, we can adapt this in order to share a linear combination of secret inputs.

Let $p_i$ be the private input belonging to participant $i$. Our goal is to share the linear combination of all their private inputs, $\sum_i p_i$ without revealing these values to the other participants.

Each player will choose $t-1$ random numbers $\{a_{i1}, a_{i2}, ... a_{it-1}\}$ themselves and constructs a unique polynomial $f_i(x) = p_i + a_{i1}x + a_{i2}x^2 ... a_{it-1}x^{t-1}$. Then, each participant $i$ will calculate the share for participant $j$ by passing in their unique number $\alpha_j$ into the function, where $\gamma_{ij} = f_i(\alpha_j)$ is the secret share that they will receive.

So every participant creates their own function, then calculates the output of their function for every other participant's unique number and shares it with them. 

Now, note that if a participant $k$ were to sum up all the secrets they've received, they would get $\sum_i \gamma_{ik} = \sum_i p_i + \sum_r (\sum_i a_{ir})\alpha_k^r$. So this is basically a point $(\alpha_k, \sum_i \gamma_{ik})$ corresponding to some polynomial of degree $t-1$, whose coefficients will be identical to all the other participants who construct a similar sum. In other words, we've achieved a $(t,n)$ secret sharing scheme for $\sum_i p_i$!

## Introducing Multiplication

What if we want to multiply secret shares? Here, we run into a problem:

Let's say secret $g_0$ is shared with the polynomial $g(x) =  \sum_k g_k x^k$ and secret $h_0$ is shared with the polynomial $h(x) =  \sum_k h_k x^k$. If you just multiply the two polynomials together, you do get the constant term to be $g_0h_0$, which is a multiplication of the secrets. However, the resultant polynomial is of degree $2t-2$ rather than $t-1$, and the coefficients are no longer random numbers.

So we have two issues to resolve.
### Degree Reduction

Degree reduction is "trivial": drop the higher degree terms and go on your way.
### Coefficient Randomization

This part gets messy. The idea is for every $k$th participant to generate a random $2t-2$ degree polynomial themself with a constant term 0. Then, these polynomials are shared and simply summed up with $g(x)h(x)$, producing a new polynomial of degree $2t-2$ that still has a constant term of $g_0h_0$ that you can just truncate higher degree terms from and continue with computation.

However, this is where a "problem" arises: the need for additional interaction between the participants to share these randomized coefficients via some sort of protocol. This is something that Nillion's MPC protocol directly addresses.
